# MATLAB Shaft Design Toolkit 

## Description

**MATLAB Shaft Design Toolkit ** is an open-source project dedicated to developing robust and efficient MATLAB code for the design and analysis of mechanical shafts. This repository aims to provide engineers, researchers, and students with a comprehensive set of tools to simplify and enhance the shaft design process, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

## Features
- **Design Calculations**: Perform key design calculations such as torsional stress, bending stress, and deflection.
- **Material Selection**: facilitate informed decisions on material selection for different shaft applications.
- **Visualization**: Generate detailed plots and graphs to visualize shear force and bending moment  distributions.
- **Documentation**: Access thorough documentation and examples to help users understand and utilize the toolkit effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DestaSyoum/MATLAB_Shaft_Design_Toolkit.git
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd MATLAB_Shaft_Design_Toolkit

### General Guidelines on How to Use the Program

1. **Change the Current Directory**:
     **Change the current directory of your MATLAB to the folder where you cloned the repository.**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DestaSyoum/MATLAB_Shaft_Design_Toolkit.git
2. **Run 'shaft_design'**:
   ```matlab
   shaft_design
3. **Run the Function 'Loads_with_position'**:
  **After running shaft_design.m, call the function Loads_with_position
 in the command window and insert the loads and their positions.**
     ```matlab
    Loads_with_position([0.4, 'pulley'], [0.8, 'gear'], [1, 'sprocket'], [1.3, 'pulley'])

4. **Follow the Instructions**:
**Follow the instructions provided by the program to complete the shaft design process.**
